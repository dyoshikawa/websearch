Reviews code specifically for vulnerabilities and malicious code.
If a GitHub PR URL is provided, it reviews that PR; otherwise, it reviews the PR
associated with the current branch.

- Tailor the review to the nature of this project (e.g. a CLI tool that runs on a
  user's local machine has a different threat model than a public web app).
- Adherence to `github-actions-security.md`.
